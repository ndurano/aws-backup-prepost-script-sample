## Pre-Post-Backup-Solution
AWS Step Functions operates as the orchestrator layer in this solution and it is responsible from combining multiple services to achieve the desired output. The state machine provided in this solution has multiple tasks that are responsible for different pieces of the workflow. At a high-level the state machine processes an input where we specify the parameters that will be used for the job execution.
Based on the input parameters, the workflow will go through multiple steps where it will perform actions such as integrating with SSM to run the defined scripts, call EC2 APIs to stop/start the EC2 instance and call the AWS Backup APIs to initiate an on-demand backup.

# Pre-Requisites
1. Create a S3 bucket to store scripts, logs

    ```
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket backup-status-bucket-<add-unique-string>
    ```

2. Upload scripts to ```backup-status-bucket-<add-unique-string>/scripts ```

    ```
    # create a pre-script
    echo "#!/bin/bash" > pre-script.sh 
    echo "" >> pre-script.sh 
    echo "echo \"Executing the pre-script\"" >> pre-script.sh 
    echo "date" >> pre-script.sh 
    echo "echo \"Completed executing the pre-script\"" >> pre-script.sh

    # put script in bucket
    aws s3api put-object --bucket backup-status-bucket-praghu --key scripts/pre-script.sh --body pre-script.sh
    ```

3. To all the EC2 instances that need to be backup add the following tag

    ```
    {
      "Key: "backup-job",
      "Value": "true"
    }
    ```

4. Install SSM agent if not already installed. Follow the steps given to [install the SSM agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-manual-agent-install.html)

5. Add an IAM instance profile to the EC2 instance to give access to SSM and S3 bucket [Create Instance Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile.html#getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile-console). Add the following managed policies to the role.

        a. AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
        b. AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

6. Extract the backupsolution-prepost.zip

    ```
    cd backupsolution-prepost
    sam deploy --guided

    Configuring SAM deploy
    ======================

        Looking for config file [samconfig.toml] :  Found
        Reading default arguments  :  Success

        Setting default arguments for 'sam deploy'
        =========================================
        Stack Name [backup-solution]: backup-solution
        AWS Region [us-east-1]: 
        #Shows you resources changes to be deployed and require a 'Y' to initiate deploy
        Confirm changes before deploy [Y/n]: Y
        #SAM needs permission to be able to create roles to connect to the resources in your template
        Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation [Y/n]: Y
        #Preserves the state of previously provisioned resources when an operation fails
        Disable rollback [y/N]: 
        Save arguments to configuration file [Y/n]: 
        SAM configuration file [samconfig.toml]: 
        SAM configuration environment [default]: 
    ```

7. Execute the step function with name `` with the following json updating the relevant fields.
   
   **BucketName** - Name of the bucket created in Step 1 (backup-status-bucket-<add-unique-string>)

   Go to CloudFormation Stack's resources tab and find the below values.
   
   **BackupJobExecutionRole** - Arn of BackupJobExecutionRole (Logical ID).

   **BackupVault** - Name of BackupVault (Logical ID).

    ```
    {
        "TargetEC2TagKey": "backup-job",
        "TargetEC2TagValue": "true",
        "StartStopEC2Required": true,
        "RemoteRunCommandDetails": {
            "PreBackupScriptDetails": {
            "SourceS3Path": "https://<BucketName>.s3.amazonaws.com/scripts/pre-script.sh",
            "CommandToRun": "pre-script.sh",
            "WorkingDirectory": "",
            "TimeoutInSeconds": 600,
            "OutputS3BucketName": "<BucketName>",
            "OutputS3KeyPrefix": "pre-script-logs"
            },
            "PostBackupScriptDetails": {
            "SourceS3Path": "https://<BucketName>.s3.amazonaws.com/scripts/pre-script.sh",
            "CommandToRun": "pre-script.sh",
            "WorkingDirectory": "",
            "TimeoutInSeconds": 600,
            "OutputS3BucketName": "<BucketName>",
            "OutputS3KeyPrefix": "post-script-logs"
            }
        },
        "BackupDetails": {
            "BackupVaultName": "<BackupVault>",
            "IamRoleArn": "<BackupJobExecutionRole>"
        }
    }
    ```

## Enable Scheduled Rule (Optional)    
If you need to run the solution on a schedule, you can 
   
   (a). Uncomment the resource PrePostBackupEventsScheduledRule in template.yaml (line numbers 189-226)
   
   (b). Edit the cron expression on line number 190 as per your requirement. [How to set CRON expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule-schedule.html#eb-cron-expressions)

   (c). Edit the input of the target (line number 195) with appropriate information. This is the input that is used to invoke the statemachine on a schedule.
   
   (d) Run ```sam deploy``` to update the stack created in step 6.
